**Greetings,**

You may be wondering why you're here.

The HTML will provide some cliff-notes; whether they provide an adequate answer
to that wonder is up to your discretion.
<br>
I would *like* to say it's up to my discretion but I also ***love*** being outside
of a courtroom - not that I've been in one... **yet**.

Hopefully the user-experience is amicable towards you, as the [codebase][CODE]
is held up by luckily-timed bug interactions. Good luÂ¢k?
